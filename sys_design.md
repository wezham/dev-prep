The question is going to be very vague. Take a breath then remember the following questions: 

The first stage is going to be planning. 

1. What are you actually building? Try and use this question to subdivide your functionality
1. Ask about the expected availability. Is the system critical ( use your judgement here )
1. Ask about performance, what sort of scale are expecting here? Should we be concerened with optimsiation
1. Ask about specific things?
1. Ask about security? 


Don't stress too much about this wes. Suppose they said design Defender. What would you ask?


1. What aspect of Defender are we designing. Do we want to design the engine which performs the check? Do we want to design 
   the process for retreiving warning banners?
1. How do clients go about checking an email? 
1. It seems like Defender is a fairly critical part of the clients lifecycle, so are we aiming for high availability? 
1. What sort of scale are we expecting here? How much data & how many requests per second? 
1. When we talk about retreving warning banners, do we need to be concenered with security?
